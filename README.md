# prompts

A collection of system prompts from real-world AI products/agents, for
analysis and comparison.

## Structure

Prompts are organized in folders by source (the tool/project they come from).
Each folder has its own `README.md` noting the license, where the files were
retrieved from (branch/tag + date), and what each file is.

This is a first pass focused on **open-source coding and code-review
agents**, where the system prompt ships directly in the project's public
source code (as opposed to being reverse-engineered/leaked from a closed
product).
