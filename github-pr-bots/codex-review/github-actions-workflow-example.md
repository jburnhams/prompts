# Build Code Review with the Codex SDK

With [Code Review](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/code-review) in Codex Cloud, you can connect your team's cloud hosted GitHub repository to Codex and receive automated code reviews on every PR. But what if your code is hosted on-prem, or you don't have GitHub as an SCM?

Luckily, we can replicate Codex's cloud hosted review process in our own CI/CD runners. In this guide, we'll build our own Code Review action using the Codex CLI headless mode with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps Pipelines, and Jenkins.

Model recommendation: use `gpt-5.5` for the strongest code review accuracy and consistency in these workflows.

To build our own Code review, we'll take the following steps and adhere to them closely:

1. Install the Codex CLI in our CI/CD runner
2. Prompt Codex in headless (exec) mode with the Code Review prompt that ships with the CLI
3. Specify a structured output JSON schema for Codex
4. Parse the JSON result and use it to make API calls to our SCM to create review comments

Once implemented, Codex will be able to leave inline code review comments:

## The Code Review Prompt

GPT-5.5 is the recommended model for complex coding workflows in Codex. You can steer GPT-5.5 to conduct a code review with the following prompt:

```
You are acting as a reviewer for a proposed code change made by another engineer.
Focus on issues that impact correctness, performance, security, maintainability, or developer experience.
Flag only actionable issues introduced by the pull request.
When you flag an issue, provide a short, direct explanation and cite the affected file and line range.
Prioritize severe issues and avoid nit-level comments unless they block understanding of the diff.
After listing findings, produce an overall correctness verdict (\"patch is correct\" or \"patch is incorrect\") with a concise justification and a confidence score between 0 and 1.
Ensure that file citations and line numbers are exactly correct using the tools available; if they are incorrect your comments will be rejected.
```

## Codex Structured Outputs

In order to make comments on code ranges in our pull request, we need to receive Codex's response in a specific format. To do that we can create a file called `codex-output-schema.json` that conforms to OpenAI's [structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) format.

To use this file in our workflow YAML, we can call Codex with the `output-schema-file` argument like this:

```yaml
- name: Run Codex structured review
        id: run-codex
        uses: openai/codex-action@main
        with:
            openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
            prompt-file: codex-prompt.md
            sandbox: read-only
            model: ${{ env.CODEX_MODEL }}
            output-schema-file: codex-output-schema.json # <-- Our schema file
            output-file: codex-output.json
```

You can also pass a similar argument to `codex exec` for example:

```bash
codex exec "Review my pull request!" --output-schema codex-output-schema.json
```

## GitHub Actions Example

Let's put it all together. If you're using GitHub Actions in an on-prem environment, you can tailor this example to your specific workflow. Inline comments highlight the key steps.

```yaml
name: Codex Code Review

# Determine when the review action should be run:
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
      - ready_for_review

concurrency:
  group: codex-structured-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  codex-structured-review:
